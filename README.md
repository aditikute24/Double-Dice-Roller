# Double Dice Roller

Welcome to the **Double Dice Roller** project! This is a simple yet interactive web application that simulates rolling two dice. It's a fun way to experience the randomness and excitement of dice rolls virtually.

## Features

- **Realistic Dice Roll Simulation**: The application simulates rolling two dice with realistic animations.
- **Visual Representation**: The dice roll is represented with dots (pips) on a 3D-like cube.
- **Responsive Design**: The application adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience across devices.

## How It Works

1. **Rolling the Dice**: Click the "Roll dice ðŸ˜Š" button to roll the two dice.
2. **Random Results**: Each roll generates a random number between 1 and 6 for both dice, and the corresponding face of the dice is displayed.
3. **Continuous Play**: Keep rolling as many times as you likeâ€”there's no limit!

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structures the webpage content.
